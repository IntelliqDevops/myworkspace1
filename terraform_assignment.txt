1 You are working on a project where you need to create an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. After your initial terraform apply, the instance is created successfully.
Later, your manager asks you to add a tag Environment = Production to that EC2 instance.
What steps would you take in Terraform to add the new tag without recreating the existing EC2 instance?
Will Terraform recreate the instance when you add a new tag? Why or why not?


2 You want to create identical infrastructure (like VPC, subnets, and EC2) in two different AWS regions using Terraform, but you don't want to copy-paste code.
How can you structure your Terraform code to easily deploy to multiple regions?
What Terraform feature can help you avoid duplication?
